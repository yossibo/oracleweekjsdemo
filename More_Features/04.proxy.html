        /*
        JavaScript has offered reflection for a long time now, with operators such as typeof and instanceof:
    
    typeof is used to know the type of an unevaluated value, which can be a primitive or an object (note that functions and arrays are also objects).
    instanceof is used to know if the prototype of a constructor is in an object's prototype chain. This requires the instanceof operator to evaluate properties from both objects.
    Letâ€™s take a look at instanceof:
    */
        // Definition of Fruit
        function Fruit() {
            this.isFood = true;
        };
        // Definition of Banana using old-style inheritance
        function Banana() {
            this.name = 'Banana';
        }
        Banana.prototype = Object.create(Fruit.prototype);
        // High level inspections
        const banana = new Banana();
        console.log(banana instanceof Banana); // true, Banana is a Fruit
        console.log(banana instanceof Fruit); // true, Fruit is an Object
        console.log(banana instanceof Object); // true



        //We can  use Proxy to return an alternative prototype, when evaluated through the proxy:
        const obj = {};
        const proxy = new Proxy(obj, {
            getPrototypeOf: function () {
                return Date.prototype;
            }
        })
        // prints true
        console.log(proxy instanceof Date);
        // also prints true
        console.log(Reflect.getPrototypeOf(proxy) === Date.prototype);
